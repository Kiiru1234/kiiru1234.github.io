    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">Daughters of Hope is an internally run, registered non profit organization that has, since 2017, been working hard to empower women in Meru county, Kenya. The organization comprises 35 members, all of whom share one common factor. </p>
    <p class="text_column">They have lost their significant other at some point in the past, and look inwards to help maneuver life and finances. The oldest member of the group is 95 years old while the youngest is 27 years old. All our members are household heads, some with children depending on them for food, shelter, education and healthcare.</p>
    <p class="text_column">We offer support for struggling widows in rural areas in 3 major ways. Emotional support to help with the grieving process, financial support to help our members become independent and stable and education to provide members an opportunity to better themselves. </p>

    <p class="parallax_description">Our immediate and high pressing need at the moment is helping our members obtain a decent roof on their heads. Currently we have about 10 members, aged between 80-95 that live in deplorable makeshift homes as a result of poverty.</p>
	  
	<p class="parallax_description">We believe that there is a high need for action for these 10 members in terms of improving their living quarters for their sake. A single housing unit can be developed for each of the 10, going for just under $3500 comprising two rooms, (one sleeping quarter and a living quarter).  </p>
	  
	<p class="parallax_description">We also intend to provide the members with a bed, two bedsheets, two blankets and two plastic chairs,and a 200 liter plastic tank for storing water.</p>
